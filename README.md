The repository contains all necessary tools to understand and replicate the project. The scripts and data sets are numbered corresponding to the following steps and their outputs. Both R and Python were used as each of them possesses unique strengths and limitations. Each script and dataset has a number corresponding to the steps discribed below e.g. Step 2, data disaggregation, has a script and output dataset labled with a "2" followed by a descriptive name. Only exception is step 1, where the data presents the input, not the output.
